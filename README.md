# Computer-Forge

The Computer Forge @ CU is a student organization dedicated to project development and teaching members about cloud computing.

We host seminars to learn about related technologies & use our Gitter chatroom to share events and help each other.

Members also get access to resources we have with the university, like VMs through our OpenStack cloud.

If you would like to join, request access to this repo.
