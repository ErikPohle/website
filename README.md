## CloudForge

The CloudForge is a student organization at the [University of Colorado,
Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) that's dedicated to cloud
computing-related learning, project work, and exploration. We aim to discuss
modern computer science technologies in a less academic-focused environment,
where we are more free to discuss new technologies that are often too new or
irrelevant to find their way into a course's standard teaching material

We'll be hosting seminars periodically throughout the semester (which is
currently fall 2017!), as well as sharing information on other topics, such as
projects, or current computing-related events.

If you're a student attending CU, and would like to join, please make a pull
request in `MEMBERS.txt` with your school email address, and we'll get in touch
with you with more information! Alternatively, we also have a public
[Slack](https://cucf.slack.com/) that you can join. Please use your school email
and full name when signing up for the Slack.
