## CloudForge

The CloudForge is a student organization at the University of Colorado,
Boulder that's dedicated to both project development, and teaching members about
systems administration, cloud computing and development operations.

We host seminars periodically to review modern computer science technologies, as
well as share projects and events that are currently happening.
